Texture Channel Manager will automatically update the output file when one of the source files are changed. For this reason it is very important that you do not overwrite one of the source files with the output of any TCM image. Otherwise, it may get caught in a loop of detecting changes, making changes, and then detecting changes again. If this does happen, you can delete the TCM asset file that was created alongside your image to prevent the loop from occurring.
